## Usage
Drag and drop your images into the empty space, you will preview three images except if you only drag one or two. Below you can see the total amount of images to convert (subtracting three from preview). If you cannot drag, click on `Add images`.

Leave the first switch on if you want to save them in the same folder, if you prefer to choose a specific folder, turn it off. You can also generate a tiny icon by turning on the second switch. Finally, click on `Convert` button, a loading circle will appear and as soon as everything is cleaned on the interface you will have your icons created.

If you need to delete the images you have added by mistake, click on the arrows icon. Remember that you can drag images as many times as you want even before clicking the `Convert` button.
