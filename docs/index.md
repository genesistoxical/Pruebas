Q'zero includes two sets: left and right-handed for better accessibility, as well as the Person and Pin cursors that were implemented in newer OS versions.

It's created to be used on light and dark backgrounds without losing sight of it, plus the waiting (danger) circle rotates for a better experience.

When using the left-handed version you will need to change the primary mouse button in Windows settings.
