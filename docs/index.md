Q'zero includes two sets: right-handed and left-handed for better accessibility, as well as including the Person and Pin cursors that were implemented in newer versions of Windows.

It is created to be used on light or dark backgrounds. The waiting circle "danger" rotates, so you will have a better experience.

Remember that when using the left-handed version, you will need to change the primary mouse button in Windows settings.
