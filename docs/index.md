Q'zero includes two sets: left and right handed for better accessibility, as well as being created to be used on light and dark backgrounds.

Another feature of this set is that they include the Person and Pin cursors that were implemented in the most recent versions of Windows, as well as the wait (danger) circle rotates, so you have a better experience.

When using the left-handed version, you'll need to change the primary mouse button in Windows settings.
