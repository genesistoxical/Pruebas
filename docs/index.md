Q'zero includes two sets: left-handed and right-handed for better accessibility, as well as the Person and Pin cursors that were implemented in newer OS versions.

It is created to be used on both light and dark backgrounds, plus the waiting (danger) circle rotates for a better experience.

When using the left-handed version you will need to change the primary mouse button in Windows settings.
