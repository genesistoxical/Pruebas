Q'zero includes two sets: left and right-handed for better accessibility, as well as Person and Pin cursors. It's created to be used on light or dark backgrounds, plus the waiting (danger) circle rotates.

When using the left-handed version you will need to change the primary mouse button in Windows settings.
