## Usage
Drag and drop your images into the empty space, you will preview three images, except if you only drag one or two. Below you can see the total amount of images to convert (subtracting three from preview). If you cannot drag, click on `Add images`.

Leave the first switch on if you want to save them in the same folder, if you prefer to choose a specific folder, turn it off. You can also generate a tiny icon by turning on the second switch. Finally, click on `Convert` button, a loading circle will appear and as soon as everything is cleaned on the interface, you will have your icons created.

If you need to delete the images you have added by mistake, click on the arrows icon. Remember that you can drag images as many times as you want even before clicking the `Convert` button.

<br>

By clicking on the upper Info button, a new window will appear in which you can:

- **Change language:** In the lower section that says Language, click on the little arrows icon to switch between Espa√±ol or English, then click on the back button and it will restart with the language you have chosen.

- **Change theme:** At the bottom, click on `Change Theme...` and choose your custom color in the small window that appears (you can help with the color palette or type in a HEX color), then select Apply. To return to the default one, repeat the previous steps and click the purple button below the tone selector, finally press Apply.

- **Find information about third-party content:** In the left section are the names of each library, project, icons or fonts that were used, as well as Drop Icons.
Click on one of them to read its license, which includes the author(s). You can read a short description below or click on the link icon to go to the repository or official site.

To choose whether Drop Icons is on top of all windows (Topmost) or not, right-click anywhere in the main window and choose Enable Topmost or Disable Topmost.

## Options

## Installer
To compile the installer you need [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php), the files are located in the [installer src](/installer%20src) folder. You just need to open the project (Installer.iss) and compile it, unless you want to make a change. When finished, it will leave a folder called Output in the same location.

**Portable.bat** allows you to quickly zip the portable version and remove unnecessary files. It only works on Windows 11 and 10.

Both .iss and .bat get the files that are needed within their folder and/or the Release folder (because of relative paths).

## Contributing
* If you make comments in the code, preferably in Spanish, please.
* Variable names must be in English.
* If you open an **Issue**, it can be in English o Spanish.
* **Pull request** in English, in the description you can add details in English or Spanish.

## Config
`Config.ini` file stores information about the language, theme color, and whether or not the Topmost option is enabled.

~~~
Language = en
Topmost = true

[Theme]
#FF9280FF

>Note: The two switch-type options are not saved because they are not options that are typically activated all the time.

## What's new?
`Version 1.0.0` was built on Windows Forms. Drop Icons will no longer be developed using that technology, however you can still find and/or download the latest official version here:
<br>
üè∑Ô∏è [winforms-v1-final](winforms-v1-final)

<br>

`Version 2.0.0` is developed with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) to create a sharper interface with responsive rounded corners, depending on the OS version.

In this latest version the "About" window has been improved, the Config.ini file has been modified to use only the theme color in HEX and not in RGB, also the color picker (for the theme) has been replaced for a much more modern one.

Due to this last change, Colors.dat was removed since there is no button to save the custom ones, instead there is a color palette.
