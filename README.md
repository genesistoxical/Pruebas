Q'zero includes two sets: left and right-handed for better accessibility. It's created to be used on light or dark backgrounds, plus the waiting (danger) circle rotates.

When using the left-handed version you will need to change the primary mouse button in Windows settings.

## Source
There are three formats as a source; the main one would be `PNG`, despite not being editable you can work on them, for example, modifying the danger circle. You can also use them in websites or applications that require a raster image format.

The next two are editable, one of them is `SVG` but doesn't include shadows since they weren't vector. The last one is the one I used but I'm sharing it because it's the original: `afdesign` for Affinity Designer v2, includes single object groups or layers in gray and yellow, but this helps to convert it to SVG.

</br>

### Convert editables to left-handed version

1. Select the **Backgrounds** and **Q'zero Cursor** layers at the same time and then click the *Flip Horizontal* button.

2. Expand the **Help** cursor group and flip the question mark that is indicated.

3. Export each cursor in PNG. **Work** and **Busy** include an animation for 8, don't forget to expand the groups and activate each danger circle one by one as indicated in the sequence.

### Convert afdesign to SVG

1. Right click on the **Pointer** cursor and choose the option of all the same label color, press the *FX* icon in the bottom bar (next to the Adjustments icon) and deactivate the *Outer shadow*.

2. Activate the visibility of all cursors and backgrounds. Expand the **Work** cursor group, right click on **w-8** and select all of the same label color, turn on their visibility to show the missing objects.

4. Export it as SVG. In the *Rasterize* option choose *Nothing*, then look for *Flatten transformations* and make sure to activate the box.

5. Edit the SVG version in a program like Inkscape, hide all the elements except for the purple background and the **Work** cursor with the danger circle **w-1**.

6. Rename the main layer to *Q'zero Cursor*, expand **Help** and change the hyphens to spaces in *Flip for Left*, lock the backgrounds layer. Finally save to overwrite.

### Convert PNG's to cursor

You can do it with your favorite editor, in this case the indications are only with animated cursors.

The animation of the **Busy** cursor must be **7s/60** (the sequence of the frames are indicated in the name) and **Work** must be **8s/60**. If you need to know where to place the Hot Spot just open an existing cursor to see the coordinates.

Big changes may not be made anymore since I have modified this cursor for about a year. In any case, sets with new designs are welcome.

If you have any request, you can let me know.
