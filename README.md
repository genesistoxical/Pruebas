## Preview

## Usage
Drag and drop your images into the empty space, you will preview three images, except if you only drag one or two. Below you can see the total amount of images to convert (subtracting three from preview). If you cannot drag, click on `Add images`.

Leave the first switch on if you want to save them in the same folder, if you prefer to choose a specific folder, turn it off. You can also generate a tiny icon by turning on the second switch. Finally, click on `Convert` button, a loading circle will appear and as soon as everything is cleaned on the interface, you will have your icons created.

If you need to delete the images you have added by mistake, click on the arrows icon. Remember that you can drag images as many times as you want even before clicking the `Convert` button.

<br>

By clicking on the upper Info button, a new window will appear in which you can:

- **Change language:** In the lower section that says Language, click on the little arrows icon to switch between Espa√±ol or English, then click on the back button and it will restart with the language you have chosen.

- **Change theme:** At the bottom, click on `Change Theme` and choose your custom color in the small window that appears (you can help with the color palette or type in a HEX color), then select Apply. To return to the default one, repeat the previous steps and click the purple button below the tone selector, finally press Apply.

- **Icons (size):** At the bottom you can click on `Icons` to display a menu with two options; **Multiple** generates icons that include all the necessary sizes (16, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256 pixels) to make it look perfect. **256 px** generates icons with a single size for users who require it, however, it may look pixelated when displayed small.

- **Find information about third-party content:** In the left section are the names of each library, project, icons or fonts that were used and details of Drop Icons, click on one to read its license, which includes the author(s). Change the page with the small **Next ü¢ñü¢ñ** link and return with **ü¢îü¢î Back**.

<br>

To choose whether Drop Icons is on top of all windows (Topmost) or not, right-click anywhere in the main window and choose Enable Topmost or Disable Topmost.

## Options

## Installer
To compile the installer you need [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php), the files are located in the [installer src](/installer%20src) folder. You just need to open the project (Installer.iss) and compile it, unless you want to make a change. When finished, it will leave a folder called Output in the same location.

**Portable with 7zip.bat** allows you to quickly zip the portable version. It only works with [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

Both .iss and .bat get the files that are needed within their folder and/or the Release folder (because of relative paths).

## Contributing
* **HandyControls** package will no longer be updated (for now or permanently) as the latest version does not allow resizing of ToggleButtonSwitch.
* If you make comments in the code, preferably in Spanish, please.
* Variable names must be in English.
* If you open an **Issue**, it can be in English o Spanish.
* **Pull request** in English, in the description you can add details in English or Spanish.
* When converting .svg it is first converted to .png in a temporary folder and then from .png to icon. The priority would be .svg "directly" to icon.
  
## Config
`Config.ini` file stores information about the language, theme color, icon size and whether or not the Topmost option is enabled.

~~~
[Options]
Language = en
Topmost = false

[Theme]
#FF9280FF

[Size]
Icons = multiple
~~~

>Note: The two switch-type options are not saved because they are not options that are usually activated all the time.

## What's new?
`Version 1.0.0` was built on Windows Forms. Drop Icons will no longer be developed using that technology, however you can still find and/or download the latest official version here:
<br>
üè∑Ô∏è [winforms-v1-final](https://github.com/genesistoxical/drop-icons/tree/winforms-v1-final)

<br>

`Version 2.0.0` is developed with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) to improve the interface and include adaptive rounded corners, depending on the OS version.

In this second release the **About** window has been improved, the **Config.ini** file has been modified to use only theme color HEX and not RGB, also the color picker (for theme) has been replaced for a much more modern one.

Due to this last change, **Colors.dat** was removed since there is no button to save the custom ones, instead there is a color palette.

<br>

`Version 2.1.1` accepts two more formats which are **.jfif .gif** and even added **.svg** support (thanks to a request). There are size options for the icons; Multiple and 256 px, also thanks to another request.
