<p>Q'zero includes the Person and Pin cursors that were implemented in newer versions of Windows. Work and Busy cursors are animated, as the "danger" circle is spinning.</p>
<p>It's created to be used on both light and dark backgrounds due to the white border or faint shadow.</p>

## Contributing
<p>Big changes may not be made anymore since I have modified this cursor for about a year. In any case, sets with new designs are welcome.</p>
<p>If you have any request, you can let me know.</p>
